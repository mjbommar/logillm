"""Few-Shot Learning for Math Problems with LogiLLM.

This example demonstrates how few-shot learning dramatically improves 
performance on grade school math problems by providing step-by-step
reasoning examples.

Math problems are an excellent test case because:
1. Without examples, models often give wrong answers
2. With a few examples showing reasoning steps, accuracy jumps significantly
3. The improvement is clear and measurable

Prerequisites:
- OpenAI API key: export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
- Install LogiLLM with OpenAI support: pip install logillm[openai]
